Problem Statement:
Design and implement a to-do application backend API that supports the following features:
● User Management:
● Create a hardcoded user within the codebase.
Implement a login endpoint that allows users to authenticate with hardcoded credentials and receive a
valid JSON Web Token (JWT)
● Task Management:
● Users should be able to add, delete, and modify tasks.
● Implement endpoints to handle these operations, including creating a new task, deleting a task, and
updating an existing task.

● Task Listing with Pagination:
● Users should be able to retrieve a list of tasks that have been added.
Implement a GET endpoint for fetching tasks that supports pagination with options for offset, limit, page
size, and page number.
User Interface:
● As UI interactions are not required, you can use Postman or any similar tool to interact with the API.
Create a Postman API collection to test and demonstrate the functionality.
Please note that this solution focuses on the backend implementation using any language of choice and
does not involve building a graphical user interface (UI).
